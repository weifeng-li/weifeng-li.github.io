#== Bio
#Weifeng Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Management Information Systems at University of Georgia, a faculty member of the Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy, and a faculty member of the Georgia Informatics Institute. I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Management Information Systems from the University of Arizona, under the supervision of Hsinchun Chen. Previously, I graduated summa cum laude from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2012 with a B.S. in Management Information Systems.

#Research interests:

#I primarily teach Cyber Threat Intelligence at the undergraduate level (MIST5775) and the graduate level (MIST7775). I also teach a doctoral seminar on Big Data Research Methods (MIST9777).
